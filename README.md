# heic-jpg-converter

An open-sourced standalone simple desktop application with one-click solution to convert single/multiple HEIC images to JPG.

My dad requested this because **Windows Photos** charges MYR 4.00 for an extension to view HEIC image and the internet has not offered a free conversion tool for desktop (and we never know if those tools are dodgy in the background).

## Getting Started

I built this on Windows but tkinter is cross-platform so feel free to experiment ðŸš€âœ¨

### Windows

1. Install Python
1. Open a terminal from this project folder and run commands:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - `pyinstaller main.spec`
1. Open the `.exe` app from the `dist/` folder

## Interface
